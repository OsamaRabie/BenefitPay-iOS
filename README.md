 ```

# Step 4: Integrating BenefitPay-iOS[](https://developers.tap.company/docs/benefit-pay-ios#step-4-benefit-pay-ios)

This integration offers two distinct options: a  [simple integration](https://developers.tap.company/docs/benefit-pay-ios#simple-integration)  designed for rapid development and streamlined merchant requirements, and an  [advanced integration](https://developers.tap.company/docs/benefit-pay-ios#advanced-integration)  that adds extra features for a more dynamic payment integration experience.

## Integration Flow[](https://developers.tap.company/docs/benefit-pay-ios#integration-flow)

Noting that in iOS, you have the ability to create the UI part of the BenefitPay-iOS by creating it as normal view in your storyboard then implement the functionality through code or fully create it by code. Below we will describe both flows:

1.  You will have to create a variable of type BenefitPayButton, which can be done in one of two ways:
    -   Created in the storyboard and then linked to a variable in code.
    -   Created totally within the code.
2.  Once you create the variable in any way, you will have to follow these steps:
    -   Create the parameters.
    -   Pass the parameters to the variable.
    -   Implement BenefitPayButtonDelegate protocol, which allows you to get notified by different events fired from within the BenefitPay-iOS SDK, also called callback functions.


##  Initialising the UI[](https://developers.tap.company/docs/benefit-pay-ios#initialising-the-ui)

> ðŸš§
> Note: You can initialise the BenefitPay-iOS SDK either using Storyboard for the UIView then implementing the functionality through code or directly create everything through Code as provided below.

### Using Storyboard
1. **Creating the BenefitPayButton in storyboard**
	1.  Drag and drop a UIView inside the UIViewController you want in the Storyboard.
	2.  Declare as of type  `BenefitPayButton`
	3.  Make an IBOutlet to the  `UIViewController`.
	4. ![enter image description here](https://i.ibb.co/pnfrmBm/Screenshot-2023-10-19-at-1-51-42-PM.png)
2. **Accessing the BenefitPayButton created in storyboard in your code**
	3. Create an IBOutlet from the created view above to your UIViewController
 ```swift
  /// The outlet from the created view above
@IBOutlet weak var benefitPayButton: BenefitPayButton!
 ```

###  Using Code to create the BenefitPayButton[](https://developers.tap.company/docs/benefit-pay-ios#using-code-to-create-the-benefitpaybutton)

-   **Creating the BenefitPayButton from code**
    
    1.  Head to your UIViewController where you want to display the `BenefitPayButton` as a subview.
    2. Import `BenefitPay-iOS` as follows `import BenefitPay_iOS` at the top of your UIViewController.
    3. Create a class variable `var benefitPayButton:BenefitPayButton = .init() ///  An instance of the benefit pay button`
    4. In the coming code sample, we will show how to create the view and how to set its layout constraints to take full width as recommended.
```swift
.
.
.
// Add it as a subview
view.addSubview(benefitPayButton)
// Make it adjusts to constraints at run time
benefitPayButton.translatesAutoresizingMaskIntoConstraints = **false**
// Set the constraints as recommended by us to have full width + leading & trailing paddings.
// Let us center vertically for demo purposes
// Height is to be set to 48
NSLayoutConstraint.activate([
benefitPayButton.leadingAnchor.constraint(equalTo: **self**.view.leadingAnchor, constant: 10),
benefitPayButton.trailingAnchor.constraint(equalTo: **self**.view.trailingAnchor, constant: -10),
benefitPayButton.centerYAnchor.constraint(equalTo: **self**.view.centerYAnchor)])
.
.
```

## Simple Integration[](https://developers.tap.company/docs/benefit-pay-ios#simple-integration)

Here, you'll discover a comprehensive table featuring the parameters applicable to the simple integration. Additionally, you'll explore the various methods for integrating the SDK, either using storyboard to create the layout and then implementing the controllers functionalities by code, or directly using code. Furthermore, you'll gain insights into how to receive the callback notifications.

### Parameters[](https://developers.tap.company/docs/benefit-pay-ios#parameters)
Each parameter is linked to the  [reference](https://developers.tap.company/docs/benefit-pay-ios#reference)  section, which provides a more in depth explanation of it.

|Parameter|Description | Required | Type| Sample
|--|--|--| --|--|
| operator| It has the key obtained after registering your package name, also known as Public key. Also, the [hashString](https://developers.tap.company/docs/webhook#validate-the-webhook-hashstring) value which is used to validate live charges. | True  | `Dictionary`| `let operator:[String:Any]: ["publicKey":"pk_test_YhUjg9PNT8oDlKJ1aE2fMRz7", "hashString":""]` |
| order| Order details linked to the charfe. | True  | `Dictionary`| ` let order:[String:String] = ["id":"", "amount":1, "currency":"SAR", "description": " description","reference":"","metadata":[:]]` |
| customer|Customer details for charge process. | True  | `Dictionary`| ` let customer = ["id":"","name":[["lang":"en","first":"TAP","middle":"","last":"PAYMENTS"]], "contact":["email":"tap@tap.company", "phone":["countryCode":"+965","number":"88888888"]]]` |


### Configuring the BenefitPay-iOS SDK[](https://developers.tap.company/docs/benefit-pay-ios#configuring-the-benefit-pay-ios-sdk)

After creating the UI using any of the previously mentioned ways, it is time to pass the parameters needed for the SDK to work as expected and serve your need correctly.

1.  **Creating the parameters**  
    To allow flexibility and to ease the integration, your application will only has to pass the parameters as a  `Dictionary[String:Any]` .  
    First, let us create the required parameters:

```swift
/// The minimum needed configuration dictionary
    let parameters: [String: Any] =
      [
      "operator": ["publicKey": "pk_test_HJN863LmO15EtDgo9cqK7sjS", "hashString": ""],
      "order": [
        "id": "",
        "amount": 0.1,
        "currency": "BHD",
        "description": "description",
        "reference": ""
      ],
      "customer": [
        "id": "",
        "name": [["lang": "en", "first": "TAP", "middle": "", "last": "PAYMENTS"]],
        "contact": [
          "email": "tap@tap.company",
          "phone": ["countryCode": "+965", "number": "88888888"],
        ],
      ],
    ]
```

2. Pass these parameters to the created Button variable before as follows
```swift
// We provide the button view the needed parameters and we assign ourselves optionally to be the delegate, where we can listen to callbacks.
benefitPayButton.initBenefitPayButton(configDict: parameters, delegate: self)
```

**Full code snippet for creating the parameters + passing it BenefitPayButton variable**
```swift
import BenefitPay_iOS
import UIKit

class ViewController: UIViewController {

  /// Create a class variable to hold your benefit pay button
  var benefitPayButton: BenefitPayButton = .init()
  /// The minimum needed configuration dictionary
  let parameters: [String: Any] =
    [
      "operator": ["publicKey": "pk_test_HJN863LmO15EtDgo9cqK7sjS", "hashString": ""],
      "order": [
        "id": "",
        "amount": 0.1,
        "currency": "BHD",
        "description": "description",
        "reference": "",
      ],
      "customer": [
        "id": "",
        "name": [["lang": "en", "first": "TAP", "middle": "", "last": "PAYMENTS"]],
        "contact": [
          "email": "tap@tap.company",
          "phone": ["countryCode": "+965", "number": "88888888"],
        ],
      ],
    ]

  override func viewDidLoad() {
    super.viewDidLoad()
    // Do any additional setup after loading the view.

    // Add it as a subview
    view.addSubview(benefitPayButton)
    // Make it adjusts to constraints at run time
    benefitPayButton.translatesAutoresizingMaskIntoConstraints = false
    // Set the constraints as recommended by us to have full width + leading & trailing paddings.
    // Let us center vertically for demo purposes
    // Height is to be set to 48
    NSLayoutConstraint.activate([
      benefitPayButton.leadingAnchor.constraint(equalTo: self.view.leadingAnchor, constant: 10),
      benefitPayButton.trailingAnchor.constraint(equalTo: self.view.trailingAnchor, constant: -10),
      benefitPayButton.centerYAnchor.constraint(equalTo: self.view.centerYAnchor),
    ])

    // let us configure the button
    benefitPayButton.initBenefitPayButton(configDict: parameters, delegate: self)

  }

}

extension ViewController: BenefitPayButtonDelegate {

}
```

### Receiving Callback Notifications[](https://developers.tap.company/docs/benefit-pay-ios#receiving-callback-notifications)

Now we have created the UI and the parameters required to to correctly display BenefitPayButton form. For the best experience, your class will have to implement BenefitPayButtonDelegate protocol, which is a set of optional callbacks, that will be fired based on different events from within the benefit button. This will help you in deciding the logic you need to do upon receiving each event. Kindly follow the below steps in order to complete the mentioned flow:

1.  Go back to  UIViewController/UiView  file you want to get the callbacks into.
2.  Head to the class declaration line
3.  Add BenefitPayButtonDelegate
4.  Override the required callbacks as follows:
```swift
  ///  Will be fired whenever there is an error related to the button connectivity or apis
  ///  - Parameter  data: includes a JSON format for the error description and error
  func onError(data: String) {
	print("\n\n========\n\nonError \(data))")
  }
	///  Will be fired whenever the charge is completed, regardless of its status.
	///  - Parameter  data: includes a JSON format for the charge details
  func onSuccess(data: String) {
	print("\n\n========\n\nonSuccess \(data))")
  }
  ///  Will be fired whenever the benefit pay button is rendered and loaded
  func onReady() {
    print("\n\n========\n\nonReady")
  }
```

**Full code snippet for creating the parameters + passing it BenefitPayButton variable + Listening to callbacks**

```swift
//
//  ViewController.swift
//  BenefitPayDemo
//
//  Created by Osama Rabie on 19/10/2023.
//

import BenefitPay_iOS
import UIKit

class ViewController: UIViewController {

  /// Create a class variable to hold your benefit pay button
  var benefitPayButton: BenefitPayButton = .init()
  /// The minimum needed configuration dictionary
  let parameters: [String: Any] =
    [
      "operator": ["publicKey": "pk_test_HJN863LmO15EtDgo9cqK7sjS", "hashString": ""],
      "order": [
        "id": "",
        "amount": 0.1,
        "currency": "BHD",
        "description": "description",
        "reference": "",
      ],
      "customer": [
        "id": "",
        "name": [["lang": "en", "first": "TAP", "middle": "", "last": "PAYMENTS"]],
        "contact": [
          "email": "tap@tap.company",
          "phone": ["countryCode": "+965", "number": "88888888"],
        ],
      ],
    ]

  override func viewDidLoad() {
    super.viewDidLoad()
    // Do any additional setup after loading the view.

    // Add it as a subview
    view.addSubview(benefitPayButton)
    // Make it adjusts to constraints at run time
    benefitPayButton.translatesAutoresizingMaskIntoConstraints = false
    // Set the constraints as recommended by us to have full width + leading & trailing paddings.
    // Let us center vertically for demo purposes
    // Height is to be set to 48
    NSLayoutConstraint.activate([
      benefitPayButton.leadingAnchor.constraint(equalTo: self.view.leadingAnchor, constant: 10),
      benefitPayButton.trailingAnchor.constraint(equalTo: self.view.trailingAnchor, constant: -10),
      benefitPayButton.centerYAnchor.constraint(equalTo: self.view.centerYAnchor),
    ])

    // let us configure the button
    benefitPayButton.initBenefitPayButton(configDict: parameters, delegate: self)

  }

}

extension ViewController: BenefitPayButtonDelegate {
  func onError(data: String) {
    print("\n\n========\n\nonError \(data))")
  }

  func onSuccess(data: String) {
    print("\n\n========\n\nonSuccess \(data))")
  }
  
  func onReady() {
    print("\n\n========\n\nonReady")
  }
}
```


## Advanced Integration

[](https://developers.tap.company/docs/benefit-pay-ios#advanced-integration)

The advanced configuration for the BenefitPay-iOS integration not only has all the features available in the simple integration but also introduces new capabilities, providing merchants with maximum flexibility. You can find a code below, where you'll discover comprehensive guidance on implementing the advanced flow as well as a complete description of each parameter.

### Parameters[](https://developers.tap.company/docs/benefit-pay-ios#parameters-1)
Each parameter is linked to the  [reference](https://developers.tap.company/docs/benefit-pay-ios#reference)  section, which provides a more in depth explanation of it.
|Configuration|Description | Required | Type| Sample
|--|--|--| --|--|
| operator|It has the key obtained after registering your package name, also known as Public key. Also, the [hashString](https://developers.tap.company/docs/webhook#validate-the-webhook-hashstring) value which is used to validate live charges. | True  | `Dictionary`| `let operator:[String:Any]: ["publicKey":"pk_test_YhUjg9PNT8oDlKJ1aE2fMRz7", "hashString":""]` |
| order| Order details linked to the charge. | True  | `Dictionary`| ` let order:[String:String] = ["id":"", "amount":1, "currency":"SAR", "description": " description","reference":"","metadata":[:]]` |
| invoice| Invoice id to link to the order (optional). | False  | `Dictionary`| ` let invoice:[String:String] = ["id":""]` |
| merchant| Merchant id obtained after registering your bundle id. | True  | `Dictionary`| ` let merchant:[String:String] = ["id":""]` |
| customer|Customer details for charge process. | True  | `Dictionary`| ` let customer:[String:Any] = ["id":"", "name":[["lang":"en","first":"TAP","middle":"","last":"PAYMENTS"]], "contact":["email":"tap@tap.company", "phone":["countryCode":"+965","number":"88888888"]]]` |
| interface| Look and feel related configurations (optional). | False  | `Dictionary`| ` let interface:[String:String] = ["locale": "en", "theme": "light", "edges": "curved", "colorStyle": "colored", "loader": true]` |
| post| Webhook for server-to-server updates (optional). | False  | `Dictionary`| ` let post:[String:String] = ["url":""]` |

###  Initialisation of the input[](https://developers.tap.company/docs/benefit-pay-ios#initialisation-of-the-input)

You can use a Dictionary  to send data to our SDK. The benefit is that you can generate this data from one of your APIs. If we make updates to the configurations, you can update your API, avoiding the need to update your app on the  App Store.

```swift
  /// The   configuration dictionary
  let parameters: [String: Any] =  [
      "operator": ["publicKey": "pk_test_HJN863LmO15EtDgo9cqK7sjS", "hashString": ""],
      "order": [
        "id": "",
        "amount": 0.1,
        "currency": "BHD",
        "description": "description",
        "reference": "",
        "metadata": [:],
      ],
      "invoice": ["id": ""],
      "merchant": ["id": ""],
      "customer": [
        "id": "",
        "name": [["lang": "en", "first": "TAP", "middle": "", "last": "PAYMENTS"]],
        "contact": [
          "email": "tap@tap.company",
          "phone": ["countryCode": "+965", "number": "88888888"],
        ],
      ],
      "interface": [
        "locale": "en",
        "theme":"light",
        "edges": "curved",
        "colorStyle": "colored",
        "loader": true,
      ],
      "post": ["url": ""],
    ]
```


###  Receiving Callback Notifications (Advanced Version)[](https://developers.tap.company/docs/benefit-pay-ios#receiving-callback-notifications-advanced-version)

The below will allow the integrators to get notified from events fired from the BenefitPayButton.

```swift
  ///  Will be fired whenever there is an error related to the button connectivity or apis
  ///  - Parameter  data: includes a JSON format for the error description and error
  func onError(data: String) {
	print("\n\n========\n\nonError \(data))")
  }
	///  Will be fired whenever the charge is completed, regardless of its status.
	///  - Parameter  data: includes a JSON format for the charge details
  func onSuccess(data: String) {
	print("\n\n========\n\nonSuccess \(data))")
  }

	///  Will be fired whenever the order is created. use it, if you want to retrieve its data from your backend for state manegement purposes
	///  - Parameter  data: Order id.
  func onOrderCreated(data: String) {
	print("\n\n========\n\nonOrderCreated \(data))")
  }
	///  Will be fired whenever the charge is created. use it, if you want to retrieve its data from your backend for state manegement purposes
	///  - Parameter  data: json data representing the charge model.

  func onChargeCreated(data: String) {
	print("\n\n========\n\nonChargeCreated \(data))")
  }
  ///  Will be fired whenever the benefit pay button is rendered and loaded
  func onReady() {
    print("\n\n========\n\nonReady")
  }
  ///  Will be fired whenever the customer clicked on the benefit pay button. Now the button will be in loading state to render the benefit pay popup
  func onClicked() {
    print("\n\n========\n\nonClicked")
  }
  
  ///  Will be fired whenever the customer cancels the payment. This will reload the button once again
  func onCanceled() {
    print("\n\n========\n\nonCanceled")
  }
```

# Generate the hash string[](https://developers.tap.company/docs/benefit-pay-ios#generate-the-hash-string)

1. Import the Crypto `import CryptoKit`
2. Copy this helper method code
```swift
/**
     This is a helper method showing how can you generate a hash string when performing live charges
     - Parameter publicKey:             The Tap public key for you as a merchant pk_.....
     - Parameter secretKey:             The Tap secret key for you as a merchant sk_.....
     - Parameter amount:                The amount you are passing to the SDK, ot the amount you used in the order if you created the order before.
     - Parameter currency:              The currency code you are passing to the SDK, ot the currency code you used in the order if you created the order before. PS: It is the capital case of the 3 iso country code ex: SAR, KWD.
     - Parameter post:                  The post url you are passing to the SDK, ot the post url you pass within the Charge API. If you are not using postUrl please pass it as empty string
     - Parameter transactionReference:  The reference.trasnsaction you are passing to the SDK(not all SDKs supports this,) or the reference.trasnsaction  you pass within the Charge API. If you are not using reference.trasnsaction please pass it as empty string
     */
    func generateTapHashString(publicKey:String, secretKey:String, amount:Double, currency:String, postUrl:String = "", transactionReference:String = "") -> String {
        // Let us generate our encryption key
        let key = SymmetricKey(data: Data(secretKey.utf8))
        // For amounts, you will need to make sure they are formatted in a way to have the correct number of decimal points. For BHD we need them to have 3 decimal points
        let formattedAmount:String = String(format: "%.3f", amount)
        // Let us format the string that we will hash
        let toBeHashed = "x_publickey\(publicKey)x_amount\(formattedAmount)x_currency\(currency)x_transaction\(transactionReference)x_post\(postUrl)"
        // let us generate the hash string now using the HMAC SHA256 algorithm
        let signature = HMAC<SHA256>.authenticationCode(for: Data(toBeHashed.utf8), using: key)
        let hashedString = Data(signature).map { String(format: "%02hhx", $0) }.joined()
        return hashedString
    }
```
3. Call it as follows:
```swift
let hashString:String = generateTapHashString(publicKey: publicKey, secretKey: secretString, amount: amount, currency: currency, postUrl: postUrl)
```
4. Pass it within the operator model
```swift
let operatorModel:[String:String] = ["publicKey": "pk_test_HJN863LmO15EtDgo9cqK7sjS", "hashString": hashString]
```
